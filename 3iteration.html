    <h2>Overview of Iteration 3</h2>

    <div class="text-box">
        <p>In Iteration 3, we added new functionality to make the app more complete and professional. This iteration was particularly challenging, as the work moved beyond standard app development tasks and required deeper Android system knowledge, which proved difficult due to our limited experience and time.</p>

<h3>1. Usage Access API Integration</h3>
<p>
    We implemented Android’s <strong>Usage Access API</strong> to detect app usage history, replacing older deprecated methods like <code>getRecentTasks()</code>.
    This API allows us to access detailed usage statistics such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Last time an app was used</li>
    <li>Total time an app was in the foreground (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)</li>
    <li>Events when apps move to foreground or background</li>
    <li>Configuration changes (e.g., device rotation)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Retention of data:</strong>  
    Daily (7 days), Weekly (4 weeks), Monthly (6 months), Yearly (2 years).
</p>
<p>
    However, implementing this was challenging. Unlike traditional app coding, accessing system-level services like Usage Stats involves special permissions, background services, and interacting with Android’s security policies.
    Due to limited time and experience, fully completing this integration was difficult.
</p>

<h3>2. Bottom Navigation View</h3>
<p>
    We added a <strong>BottomNavigationView</strong> to improve navigation across the app.
    Cognify now has two main screens:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Home:</strong> The settings screen</li>
    <li><strong>Games:</strong> A screen listing the three available cognitive games</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Improved Language Options</h3>
<p>
    The language selector (Norwegian and English) was expanded to cover the entire app — including all screens, buttons, and labels.
    <br>
    <strong>Exception:</strong> The pop-up notification still uses the system-level <code>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</code> overlay, which is separate from the app's normal UI and harder to localize.
</p>

<h2>Challenges in Iteration 3</h2>

<p>
    Compared to earlier iterations, Iteration 3 involved more complex Android system features, which were unfamiliar to us as Bachelor students. 
    Specifically, working with system-level services required understanding concepts such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>WorkManager</strong> – for managing background tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications and Notification Channels</strong> – to deliver user alerts</li>
    <li><strong>Post Notifications Permission</strong> – mandatory in Android 13+</li>
    <li><strong>Overlay Permissions</strong> – for drawing over other apps</li>
    <li><strong>System Alert Windows</strong> – managing overlays and pop-ups</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These concepts introduced new technical challenges compared to "normal" app coding, where we were more familiar with layouts, activities, and view models. 
    Working at the system level required a shift in thinking, more research, and handling complex permission flows.
